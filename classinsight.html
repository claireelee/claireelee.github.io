      <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
        <p class="justify">
          ClassInSight is a project that investigates how smart classrooms can sense in-class activities and provide feedback and training to novice instructors at the college and university level. Currently, the project focuses on helping instructors improve their in-classroom discursive practices, such as asking more content-based questions increase student participation and engagement.
        </p>

        <p class="justify">
          I began working with the ClassInSight team in Fall 2020, after the preliminary classroom data collection and user interviews had taken place. My role in this project was to derive insights from the consolidated data and creating informed prototype designs of the final ClassInSight user dashboard. 
        </p>

      <h3><b>Data Analysis</b></h3>
        <p class="justify">
          <p class="justify">

        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          We began by doing a thematic analysis of the interviews conducted with the instructors. In the interviews, instructors were shown their nonverbal classroom behavior data, which included data on their relative location within the classroom and their gaze distribution (% of time that they spent looking at students, their device, the board, etc.). These interviews prompted teachers to discuss their assessment of the data, other data that they would like to see, and their goals for improving their nonverbal behaviors in the classroom. 
        </p><br>

        <p class="justify">
          Through our data analysis, we found 4 main insights:
        </p>

        <p class="justify">
          <h3 class="highlight">1. Teachers are interested in classroom data.</h3> They want to see data on their own behaviors as well as those of their students in order to understand and explore the link between classroom data and classroom performance.
        </p><br>
        <p class="justify">
          <h3 class="highlight">2. Teachers expressed a desire to improve their nonverbal classroom behaviors.</h3> Providing teachers with better resources and insights is a crucial step in identifying opportunities to improve the educational experience for both the teacher and the student.
        </p><br>
        <p class="justify">
          <h3 class="highlight">3. There are technological, physical, and social barriers that prevent change in the classroom.</h3> Being aware of these obstacles (such as classroom size, furniture, device setup) allows us to tailor our solutions to address each individual teacher's unique classroom challenges.
        </p><br>
        <p class="justify">
          <h3 class="highlight">4. There's a tradeoff between time and training.</h3> We have to find the balance between effective and feasible solutions for behavior change.    
        </p>

        <br>



      <h3><b>Prototyping</b></h3>

        <p class="justify">
          With these conclusions in mind, our team began our prototyping phase. We started out by making sketches of potential dashboard elements based on our user interview insights.
